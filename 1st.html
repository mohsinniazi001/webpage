            <h1>About Isuzu Ute</h1>
        </p>
        <p>Isuzu Motors' history began in 1916, when Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd. planned a cooperation with the Tokyo Gas and Electric Industrial Company to build automobiles.
            <ul>
                <li> The next step was taken in 1918, when a technical cooperation with Wolseley Motors Limited was initiated, yielding exclusive rights to the production and sales of Wolseley vehicles in East Asia from knock-down kits.</li>
                <li> In 1919 came the first ever Japan-produced passenger car, a Wolseley model, the Fifteen A9 15/40 НР at the Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipyard at the Fukagawa Factory.</li>
                <li> The Wolseley sourced CP truck followed two years later; 550 of these were built by 1927.</li>


                <li> In 1923 Japan was devastated by the Kanto earthquake which made the fledgling transportation infrastructure that was heavily reliant on government-owned railroads unusable due to the twisted tracks.</li>
                <li> Heavy construction vehicles were imported from the United States companies GMC and Ford to aid in recovery and reconstruction, and the company sought to contribute by producing locally built construction and heavy duty vehicles.</li>
                <li>
                    In 1927 the company introduced its 2-ton load capacity "Sumida P-type truck" equipped with an A6 engine and a 1-ton vehicle "Sumida M-type No. 1 bus" equipped with an A4 engine. The name "sumida" was used from the Sumida River as the factory at Fukagawa
                    was close by.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 style="color: black;">The 5 Advantages of Running an Isuzu Truck</h1>
        <p>There are many advantages to running an Isuzu truck. We have always cared about our customers and the success of their businesses, and understand that a company’s success or failure can depend upon the efficiency of its vehicles.</p>
        <p>This is why we have developed our award-winning customer care programme, a unique and comprehensive customer service programme designed around the challenges our customers face.</p>
        <p>Alongside our customer care programme, there are a number of other important benefits associated with running an Isuzu truck. We’ve compiled them here to help you compare and contrast our vehicles with those of our competitors:</p>

        <h1>Payload</h1>
        <p>All of the trucks in our range are designed and engineered for maximum payload capacity, increasing the weight you can carry on each journey and reducing the total number of journeys you have to take.</p>
        <h1>Reliability</h1>
        <p>Innovative engineering makes our vehicles robust and reliable. They are designed to cope in some of the world’s most challenging environments and terrains, making them a good choice if you require a vehicle that can withstand prolonged use and
            punishment.
        </p>
        <h1>Compact Footprint</h1>
        <p>The compact cab design of our vehicles makes them ideal for multi-drop delivery companies, as the cabs are lower to the ground and provide easier access for drivers and passengers. The shorter cab length also means our trucks have a tighter turning
            circle, which makes it much easier to manoeuvre them in and around housing estates and narrow country lanes that would otherwise be difficult to access.</p>


        <h1>Low Cost of Ownership</h1>
        <p>An Isuzu truck is a sound investment for your business. Not only are our vehicles competitively priced and available with a range of flexible finance options, you can bring your whole vehicle life cost down by agreeing a fixed-price repair and
            maintenance contract with our R&M team.</p>
        <h1>CARE Programme</h1>
        <p>When you buy an Isuzu truck you are automatically included in our award-winning customer CARE programme. As part of the programme you will be assigned a Customer Care Liaison Executive who will contact you at regular intervals to ensure you are
            happy with your truck(s) and the service you are receiving from us.</p>
